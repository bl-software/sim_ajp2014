# sim_jtb2012

June 2025 update - Code Dump
Funding was cut, so this software is in the state it is in.  There will be bugs.
the bl-software/sim_rbco2 is supposed to be superset of this code, however there are differences.  If something doesn't work here, it is possible it does work there.  sim_rbco2 is the best documented.
Good Luck


Oocyte simulations supporting AJP 2014 Paper "Evidence from mathematical modeling that carbonic anhydrase II and IV enhance CO2 fluxes across Xenopus oocyte plasma membranes" https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00049.2014

The simulations run now - but the specific params to match the paper figures might not be correct.  About 1/2 done as of 5/30/2025.
